# BNO055-NRF24-Python
Reference to : https://toptechboy.com/arduino-based-9-axis-inertial-measurement-unit-imu-based-on-bno055-sensor/

I added a NRF24 transmitter to the 9-Axis IMU LESSON 21: Understanding 3D Rotations and QuaternionsIMU sketch.

I added a NRF 24 reciever, which sends the received data to the Python script.

In VPython the object (my breadboard) moves in the space background.

The space background moves opposite the yaw of the object.

Why all this? : Just for fun!!  
Subject to improvement
